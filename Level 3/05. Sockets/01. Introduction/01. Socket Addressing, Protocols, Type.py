Socket is an endpoint of a communication channel used by programs to send/recv
data locally or widely across the Internet.

    Properties:
        Address family
            Controls Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network layer protocol
            
            OSI Model:
                Application Layer (SL)
                    Provides a user interface
                    
                Presentation Layer (SL)
                    Presents data
                    Handles encryption/decryption
                    
                Session Layer (SL)
                    Maintains distinction between data of separate applications
                    
                Transport Layer
                    Provides end-to-end connections
                    
                Network Layer (HL)
                    Provides logical addressing
                    
                Data Link Layer (HL)
                    Provides media access and physical addressing
                    
                Physical Layer (HL)
                    This layer puts and receives data on the physical media as
                        bits
                    Hubs work at this layer



        Socket type
            Controls transport layer protocol
